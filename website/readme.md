# data-scapes project documentation

## First steps

The original intentions of my time in CART-411 relied heavily on past projects from by data patterns series, and the general topic of finding new collaborative methodologies between human and non-human, especially between artisanal fashion work and A.I. processes. An added layer in this iteration was to find ways of telling stories with our analog data, too. The first writings of the semester hitted towards a more material and fashion-oriented project:

### First writings

Data Patterns is a project and research on how digitally generated and collected data impact consumerist objects, especially within clothing and fashion. While researching on this topic, I found myself reminiscing paper trails of pre-computer artisanship. Indeed, we are rapidly losing traces of analog history which have not been translated into our modern world. Genevieve, my ever-moving grandmother, lost all her fashion designs, papers and patterns through her life. By creating a community-based corpus of digitalized paper sewing patterns, I wish to construct a tool allowing ‘material’ media to impact our modern tools, such as AI, in a permanent fashion.
Stuck in the battle between copy rights infringements and critical analysis of creativity itself, many fail to conceive of AI or ‘AI art’ as one of the artist’s many tools. Commercial and artistically geared AI systems access almost uncontrollable amounts of data which the individual user has no power on. Moreover, these systems lack large amounts of data created before the digital age, namely those of artists and artisans. By creating a community-based corpus of historical sewing patterns, my goal is not only to prototype with a more controlled pool of data but also to ensure artisanship’s legacy in the digital age.

While trying to conceive of new ways humans and machines could work together, I came to explore technologies such as Dall-e, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. My goal was to generate shapes that looked like sewing patterns and interpretate them into wearable clothing pieces. Although the research was conclusive in finding some methodologies for artisanship and AI to collaborate, the fact I had no control on the data I was fetching from meant I had little control on what I could receive. Instead of the anticipated technical 2D sewing patterns, all I received were silhouettes of already worn clothes. Creating a very specific corpus of sewing patterns will therefore allow more accurate results in the next stages of the research.

While creating a better tool for research, this project also aims to ensure that analog data of artists and artisans, especially patternmakers and seamstresses, are transferred to the digital realm. Both my grandmother’s lost paper-trails of her designer’s past and my best friend’s grandmother’s old sewing patterns’ collection she’s given me were my inspiration for this project. However, my hope is to gather more collections of personal and commercial analog patterns coming from all times and spaces. The resources of this grant will be used to find and collect those historical paper pattern collections and digitalize them using specialized equipment.
My research prompted the creation of this sewing patterns corpus which it will become a valuable tool for. However, it will hopefully live on to also become an open source and community-based space where one can share and find once analog patterns free of rights.

## Literature review and project reorientation

The full literature review of my project will undeniably grow as the project evolves, and will be added to data-scapes' landing page where the original inspirations already reside. The literature review was --and remains, a step I did not want to minimize from my project. As a Fine Arts student, I often feel stuck in a 13-week production-intensive schedule loop which often limits the contemplative period of my projects; the time-space where I can reshape and redirect the ways I approach my artistic endeavors. I got reminded of a very effective advice I got given years ago, which is to "fall in love with a problem rather than its solution". And so I gave myself the task of wondering exactly what was the problem I wanted to solutionize; and if the material and fashion-oriented solution I was trying to fit into my problem was really the best one.
Through my research, it became apparent, and frankly dizzying, to recognize how much our data had an undeniable and insidious impact on a majority of spheres of our lives. By data is understood not only the ones that we create, but also the ones that is collected from us, inferred and modelled, as well as returned to us via screens or built objects ('real life' products). As much as nutrition and general healthy physical habits are concerns to our individual health, our 'data health' should be taken as seriously. However, because its 'lack of physicality' (Ahmed) and the completely unrelatable sheer quantity of it (Slovic 2007), 'data' as a concept intimidates and/or renders the general public completely numb to it. The complex nuances of algorithms, neural networks, language models, Gans and so forth are also all erased under the umbrella of the 'A.I.' buzzword that amasses more readers than any of the aforementioned mechanisms combined.
We simplify complex notions so we can understand them better, but it makes us understand them less. By saying every other machine is an 'artificial intelligence', we anthropomorphize machines that maybe should not be. Or at least, we anthropomorphize the 'wrong' parts of the machine. Let me explain.

The 'black box' problem. Neural networks and deep learning algorithms often make us believe that once they get going, it is as if they had a mind of their own, an agency of some kind, something out of humans' control. In my years as a computation arts students, I have often testified of the general belief that algorithms simply work by themselves.
This is of course a fallacy. Indeed, it is humans -- with their own biases and horizons, that create the algorithms. It is humans, a lot of them, who feed them. It is also humans, with specific goals in mind, that extract whatever data from them. The process is fundamentally human; there is no black box, everything comes from us.
So, with all of that in mind, it became futile to be thinking of a fashion-based project. I needed to find ways of approaching data literacy in an engaging, dynamic, perhaps fun (?) way. My main topic remained; I also wanted to find new ways of telling different stories with our data.

## data-scapes

This iteration of data-scapes, which will hopefully evolve in the next months and years, aims to answer two main questions:

    - How can we rethink and reshape knowledge sharing methodologies to enable a greater population to *want* to access complex and nuanced information that can foster critical thinking;
    - How can we visualize different stories from the users' data mapped on [other data]

From then on, I started experimenting with the ways I could both share what I had learned from my research, and also how I could use user data and other information resources to 'tell other stories', which was kind of vague but a direction that interested me a lot.

I chose geolocation information as the basis of my database for multiple reasons. I had already done a previous project that collected the latitude and longitude of some 150 people across the globe, which already rendered the project visually interesting. With that in mind, I also have a political science degree and am quite interested in different mapping and projection methodologies (more on that on the data-scapes' website). Projections and the way we draw out the borders of our countries tell thousands of stories in themselves. We have however been accustomed to those stories in such intrinsic ways, we no longer view them as stories but rather as objective truth supported by empirical evidences.

The same way all map are distorted in some ways, data can tell different stories depending on how it is distorted, and who distorts it.É

So how do I say, and show, all of that in a digestible way?

The idea of a rhizome and using non-linearity and 'bite-size' information was really important from the get-go. I did not want the information to feel overwhelming, or dictating in which way it should be digested, as opposed to a more conventional linear article. The idea was to allow the user to pick whichever resources, or node, they wanted and read a brief introduction of the resource material. If they felt interested in it, they could continue their exploration on a bridged node, or any other one. To add to the dynamism and interactivity, I embedded animated SVGs. The grabbable linked up floating nodes give an slightly gamified ambiance that keeps the user fascinated/entertained by the content.

-> By using leaflet.js instead of Google Maps API, I was able to customize the map a lot more than the first iteration of the project. This allowed me to be able to change the map/tile/projection under the data-scapes' thread formed by users' geolocation. By turning the map tile fully black, I saw data-scapes' thread, alone, for the first time. This made me realize that sometimes less is indeed more, and the user thread was a stand alone piece, too. It deserved to be portrayed as such. And so instead of the maximalist tendencies I usually take with my projects, I decided to work towards minimalism instead.

![glitched mrct map](https://github.com/Sarah-hm/data-scapes/blob/main/website/documentation/data-scapes-glitched-map.png)
-> when I put the tile in the first time around, I created very weird glitches by inputting the wrong x, y, z variables. When I realized my mistake, I had fun playing around with the glitch and looking at where the thread was instead pointing towards. I also spent some time recognizing (or not) some misplaced countries; how arbitrary the map looked now. With the knowledge of how map projections come to exist, with a few people deciding what is most important to distort/keep intact, it made me realize how completely arbitrary the very story of the Mercator projection itself was.
We often think of 'stories' as subjective folkore, but stories build objective truth. Our data is told through stories, which we often interpret as being objective truth. What if we used different kinds of map to showcase other stories?

![glitch nl map](https://github.com/Sarah-hm/data-scapes/blob/main/website/documentation/data-scapes-glitches-native-land.png)
->[native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) is an incredible open-source resource and a rabbit hole I often find myself falling into. In the context of data-scapes however, native-land also tells stories about the same land we usually see within very specific visualization. The overlapping of polygons are the testimony of different time-spaces present at once. The territories, treaties or languages accounted for by Native-land, which do not claim to be a complete or official resource, may belong to different times but are regarded portrayed on the same mapped layer.

This in itself, in reciprocity with the Mercator Projection and contemporary binary boarder cuttings, tells stories about the way we shape, hierarchize and propagate information through not only space, but time. The way the global North 'cuts' countries would never allow for any overlapping, let alone the fantom of an old conquered nation.

The hovering effect over the native-land polygons was born from a glitch, like most effects in this project. I enjoyed creating a vague, questioning experience that users need to unfold. Being meant with only the data-scapes thread, and having 'random' shapes appear when hovering over it, creates an uncanny feeling. The user cannot fully understand what it is they are dealing with. Upon further inspection of the platform, they can open the information boxes and learn more, uncover, what it is they are looking at. This soft fascination, mixed with the minimalism of the simple visualization, helps the user appropriate the map and all its information bit by bit.
